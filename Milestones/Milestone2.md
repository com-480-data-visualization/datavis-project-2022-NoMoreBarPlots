**Figure 1** - Sketch of the Global Map and Sankey flow.

It will be an interactive visualization by country of data on production, consumption, losses, imports and exports of the energies present in the country.

The first page will consist of a map where the user can click on a country to get the corresponding information. The Maps and Interaction courses will be used for this, especially the concept of event (here, a click on the map) and navigation (geometric zoom on the country).

Thanks to a click on the country, the map will zoom in on it, the zoom on the country will go into a transparent background and a sankey flow type graph will appear in the center of the page. The graph will be composed of: on the left the production rates, on the top the import rates, on the right the total consumption rates and losses, on the bottom the export rates. At first, faded sankey flows and the main rates visualized with different color blocks for each energy are visible, to deal with estimated quantities, the corresponding blocks are white. The colors for the blocks representing each energy will be chosen thanks to the course about perception, especially the parts about the color palette choice. Also, the course about Marks and channels helped to choose the geometry of the visualized data. By passing the mouse over an energy, the corresponding sankey flow becomes darker and the numerical quantities are displayed. This event (mouseover) will be possible thanks to the course about Interaction. A plus would be to have the flow appear gradually (transition) from production and imports to consumption, losses and exports : an animation from the Interaction course is needed here. Another plus would be that, by clicking on the consumption side, the distribution by consumption area appears : an event and a focus from the Interaction course has to be used. A slider showing the years will be present to be able to change the year, the transition should be made in a smooth way for the color blocks representing the energies : brushing and transitions from the Interaction course have to be used. One could also imagine being able to activate an automatic transition showing all the years (like a movie). Finally, clicking on an energy would automatically switch to the second energy visualization or pressing the back button returns to the world map : once again this is an event. Note that we are dealing with quantitative data with different attributes in this data visualization.

Note that in the sketch of Figure 1, the sankey flow present is not the one we will create for our representation, it was just used as an example.


### Visualization 2: Bubble chart race

**Figure 1** - Sketch of the bubble chart race visualization.

Through this visualization, we want to propose a way to visualize the evolution of an energy quantity (such as consumption, production, ... of a given energy) through time, while having an overall view on the different countries. For this purpose, we have chosen to create a bubble chart race, where each bubble corresponds to a country and the associated energy quantity is represented by the radius of each bubble. As we only have annual quantities, we will linearly interpolate these quantities in order to have an animation of the bubble chart race. To make our bubble chart race, we will need to take inspiration from the readings in week 5 (for the interactions), as well as some of the bubble chart and bar chart race implementations available on D3.js. In order not to overload our visualisation, we have also chosen not to specify the name or abbreviation of the name of each country within each bubble so as to display only the countries with the highest energy content. In addition, we will also display the 5 largest quantities and the associated countries in the top left corner of the visualisation (the number 5 is for the moment a bit arbitrary, it will depend on the most suitable layout we find). We are fully aware that not displaying the names of all the countries limits the information transmitted by our visualisation. To overcome this problem, we have several ideas that we will implement once the main part of this visualisation is implemented. Indeed, we will add an option to filter the countries that we want to appear in the bubble chart race, either by selecting the countries one by one, or by choosing the continents for which we want the countries to participate in the bubble chart race. Another option we will add will be to be able to highlight a country by moving the associated bubble away from the others and displaying the energy quantity associated with the selected country below. The last option we want to implement will be to propose to the user to choose an operation to apply to the energy quantity or to choose a second energy quantity to apply to both quantities. To illustrate this, we can imagine for example having a bubble chart race where the quantity of interest would be the difference between the production and consumption of a certain energy or a bubble chart race where the quantity of interest would be the inverse of the quantity of oil consumed, so as to highlight the countries that consume the least oil and not those that consume the most. This last option would have a lot of freedom and could lead to comparisons that would not make sense, such as looking at the difference between oil production and electricity exports from wind power, but this aspect would be up to the user, to whom we would leave the possibility of relating the data as he or she sees fit. For the choice of the colour scheme, we will mainly use the slides from week 6, each continent will have its own colour. In addition, to highlight the fact that certain quantities are estimated, we have chosen to display the associated bubbles in white in order to make this aspect of the data visual. If for a given country, the energy quantity of interest changes from an estimated value to an exact value, or vice versa, we will make a linear transition from white to the colour of the associated continent.


### Website basic skeleton

You find the basic skeleton of the website thanks to the following link: [website](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/datavis-project-2022-NoMoreBarPlots/Website/index.html).
The website is composed of a home page presenting the objective of the project with two buttons allowing access to the two visualizations, two pages presenting the two visualizations, a description of the data and the team. A menu will allow you to go from one page to another. A plus would be to have the home page animated: the presentation of the project's objective appears on the screen little by little, then two buttons appear allowing access to the two visualizations.
